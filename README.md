# Assignment Portal

A web application to manage assignment submissions and student progress, using Node.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose.

## Features

- User authentication (JWT-based)
- Database connectivity with MongoDB Atlas
- Secure routes with JWT
- Assignment submission and tracking functionality
- Responsive design

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed before setting up the project:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18.14.1 or later)
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) account (for remote database)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/assignment-portal.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd assignment-portal
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file at the root of the project:

   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

   Add the following lines to the `.env` file:

   ```bash
   DATABASE=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   PORT=5000
   ```

   Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, and `<dbname>` with your MongoDB credentials and the database name.

5. Whitelist your IP address in MongoDB Atlas:

   - Navigate to MongoDB Atlas dashboard.
   - Go to **Network Access** and add your IP address (`45.118.156.6`).
   - Alternatively, add `0.0.0.0/0` to allow access from any IP address (useful for testing).

## Running the Application

1. Start the application using Nodemon:

   ```bash
   nodemon server.js
   ```

2. You should see the following output if everything is connected properly:

   ```bash
   Server running on port 5000
   DB connected
   ```

3. Visit `http://localhost:5000` to view the application.

## Usage

- Register or log in to the platform.
- Submit assignments or view progress reports.
- Admins can manage assignments and student data.
